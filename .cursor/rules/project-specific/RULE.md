# Rate Limiting and Security Rules

Rate limiting patterns for Supabase Edge Functions. See Legacy section for deprecated Firebase implementation.

## When to Implement Rate Limiting

Implement rate limiting for:

### Expensive Operations
- Database scans (list operations, full table queries)
- Batch operations (backfill, migrate, sync)
- External API calls with costs (OpenAI, payment gateways)
- File uploads/downloads
- Report generation

### Write Operations
- User data mutations (profile updates, permission changes)
- Status changes (feature toggles, developer status)
- Content creation (posts, messages)
- Any operation modifying shared state

### Authentication-Related Functions
- Password reset requests
- Email verification sends
- Account creation
- Login attempts (use exponential backoff)

### Public or Semi-Public Endpoints
- Callable functions accessible by non-admin users
- Webhooks
- API proxies

## Rate Limiting Strategy

### Storage: PostgreSQL Table

Store rate limit counters in a `rate_limits` table with:
- Composite primary key: `{user_id}_{function_name}`
- Fields: `user_id`, `function_name`, `count`, `window_start`, `last_request`, timestamps
- Index on `(user_id, function_name)` for query performance

### Row Level Security

**SSOT:** See `security/RULE.md` for RLS policy patterns.

Enable RLS on `rate_limits` table. Create policy blocking all client access (service role bypasses RLS, allowing Edge Functions access while blocking clients).

## Implementation Pattern

### Helper Function

Create reusable rate limit checker in `supabase/functions/_shared/rateLimit.ts`:

Function signature: `checkRateLimit(userId, action, maxRequests, windowMs): Promise<boolean>`

Behavior:
- Use service role key to access `rate_limits` table
- Generate limit ID as `{userId}_{action}`
- Fetch existing record or create new one on first request
- Reset counter when time window expires
- Increment counter within window
- Return `false` when limit exceeded, `true` otherwise
- Fail open: return `true` on errors to avoid blocking legitimate users

### Apply to Edge Functions

Call rate limit check after authentication, before main logic:

1. Authenticate user
2. Authorize user (if needed)
3. Check rate limit
4. Validate input
5. Execute main logic
6. Handle errors

Return HTTP 429 with user-friendly message when rate limit exceeded.

## Rate Limit Guidelines

### Suggested Limits by Operation Type

| Operation Type | Limit | Window | Reasoning |
|---------------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Read-heavy (lists, queries) | 10-20 | 1 minute | Allow reasonable browsing |
| Write operations | 5-10 | 1 minute | Prevent spam/abuse |
| Expensive operations | 2-5 | 5 minutes | Protect costs |
| Batch operations | 1-2 | 5-10 minutes | Very expensive |
| Authentication | 3-5 | 15 minutes | Prevent brute force |
| Password reset | 2 | 1 hour | Prevent email spam |

### Adjust Limits Based On
- User role (admins/developers can have higher limits)
- Cost (stricter limits for paid API calls)
- Database load (stricter limits for heavy queries)
- Abuse risk (stricter limits for public endpoints)

## Error Messages

Use clear, user-friendly messages that specify retry timing:
- "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again in a minute."
- "Rate limit exceeded. This is an expensive operation. Please try again in 5 minutes."
- "Too many requests. Please wait 15 minutes before trying again."

Avoid generic messages like "Rate limit exceeded" or "Error 429".

## Testing

### Manual Testing
Execute multiple sequential requests exceeding the limit. Verify first N requests succeed and subsequent requests return 429.

### Automated Testing
Create test that makes `maxRequests` successful calls, then verify next call returns `false` from rate limit checker.

## Monitoring and Cleanup

### Monitor Rate Limits
Query `rate_limits` table for records near limit threshold. Look for high counts, users hitting multiple limits, and abuse patterns.

### Automatic Cleanup
Delete records older than 24 hours using:
- PostgreSQL function with pg_cron scheduler, or
- Scheduled Edge Function that deletes old records

## Privacy and Security

### Benefits
- No third-party tracking
- User privacy preserved
- Full control over limits and data
- GDPR-friendly

### Security Rules

**SSOT:** See `security/RULE.md` for RLS policy patterns.

Protect `rate_limits` table with RLS policy blocking all client access.

### Fail Open vs Fail Closed

Default implementation uses "fail open": allow requests when rate limit check fails due to errors.

Reasoning:
- Prevents blocking legitimate users during outages
- Better UX than false positives
- Logs errors for monitoring

Use "fail closed" for:
- Authentication endpoints (security > UX)
- Payment processing
- Critical operations

## Checklist for New Functions

Before deploying:
- [ ] Function is abusable (expensive/write/public)?
- [ ] Added `checkRateLimit()` call?
- [ ] Chose appropriate limits (requests/window)?
- [ ] Error message is user-friendly?
- [ ] Added JSDoc with rate limit info?
- [ ] Tested rate limit manually?
- [ ] `rate_limits` table protected with RLS?
- [ ] Using service role key for rate limit checks?

## Summary

Every abusable Edge Function should:
1. Authenticate the user
2. Authorize the user (if needed)
3. Check rate limit
4. Validate input
5. Execute main logic
6. Handle errors gracefully

Rate limiting protects:
- Supabase costs
- External API costs (OpenAI, etc.)
- Database from abuse
- User experience (no slowdowns from abuse)

Without:
- Third-party tracking
- User privacy concerns
- Complex external dependencies

## Legacy: Firebase Cloud Functions (Deprecated)

> **Note:** Legacy Firebase Cloud Functions rate limiting implementation. Project migrated to Supabase Edge Functions. Kept for reference during migration period.

Previously used Firestore collection with document ID format `{uid}_{functionName}` containing `count`, `windowStart`, and `lastRequest` fields.

Migration: Replaced with Supabase PostgreSQL table and Edge Function implementation (see above).

## Related Rules

**When modifying this rule, check these rules for consistency:**
- `security/RULE.md` - **SSOT** for RLS policy patterns
- `cloud-functions/RULE.md` - Edge Functions architecture and when to use them
- `database/RULE.md` - Database migration patterns for rate_limits table

**Rules that reference this rule:**
