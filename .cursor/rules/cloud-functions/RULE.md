# Cloud/Edge Functions Architecture

## Purpose

This rule defines:
- **When to use Edge Functions** vs frontend logic (decision framework)
- **How to organize** functions by business capability
- **Architecture patterns** and deployment considerations

## Function Location

**SSOT:** See `architecture/RULE.md` for project structure and directory organization standards.

**Function Location Guidelines:**

- **Supabase Edge Functions**: MUST be housed in `supabase/functions/`
  - Each function is a subdirectory: `supabase/functions/<function-name>/index.ts`
  - Shared utilities: `supabase/functions/_shared/`
  - Deploy via: `supabase functions deploy <function-name>`

- **Other Cloud/Edge Functions** (Cloud Run, Railway, etc.):
  - Location: `cloud-functions/<service-name>/`
  - Example: `cloud-functions/greenpt-proxy/` for Cloud Run/Railway deployments
  - These are separate from Supabase Edge Functions and use different runtimes (Node.js, etc.)

For complete project structure guidelines, refer to `architecture/RULE.md`.

## Critical Context: Deployment Model

**This project has experimental and main branches that share ONE Supabase project.**

- Frontend code deploys separately per branch (experimental vs main)
- Edge Functions deploy ONCE and affect BOTH branches
- No staging environment for Edge Functions
- No automated testing or rollback for functions
- Bugs in Edge Functions impact the entire app across all branches

**Consequence:** Edge Functions are MORE fragile than frontend code in this architecture.

## When to Use Edge Functions

### ✅ Required Use Cases

Use Edge Functions ONLY when absolutely necessary:

1. **Security-Critical Operations**
   - Operations that must never be client-side for security
   - Example: Admin privilege escalation, payment processing
   - Pattern: Client cannot be trusted with the logic

2. **Server-Only Capabilities**
   - Operations requiring server-side secrets/keys
   - Example: Third-party API calls (Gamma API, payment gateways)
   - Pattern: Credentials must stay server-side

3. **System Events**
   - Supabase Auth lifecycle (handled via database triggers, not Edge Functions)
   - Pattern: System-initiated, not user-initiated

4. **Existing Functions**
   - Current Edge Functions in this project (located in `supabase/functions/`):
     - `gamma-generate` / `gamma-status` - Presentation generation (server-side API)
     - `tool-execute` - Unified tool execution endpoint (image generation, Gamma, etc.)
     - `migrate-base64-files` - File migration utility
     - Database triggers handle user creation automatically (not Edge Functions)

### ❌ Avoid Edge Functions For

**Do NOT use Edge Functions for:**

1. **Data Aggregation / Calculations**
   - ❌ Bad: Database triggers to sum/count data
   - ✅ Good: Frontend uses PostgreSQL `UPDATE ... SET column = column + value` during saves
   - Reason: Frontend is testable per-branch; function bugs affect all branches

2. **User-Initiated Operations**
   - ❌ Bad: Edge Function triggered by user action
   - ✅ Good: Frontend handles directly, uses Supabase client with atomic operations
   - Reason: Frontend failures are isolated; function failures are global

3. **Transformations**
   - ❌ Bad: Edge Function to transform/validate data on write
   - ✅ Good: Frontend transforms before writing, RLS policies validate
   - Reason: Logic changes can be tested on experimental branch first

4. **Notification Logic**
   - ❌ Bad: Edge Function to send notifications on events
   - ✅ Good: Frontend sends via client SDK or scheduled job
   - Reason: Notification failures shouldn't block entire app

## Pattern: Frontend with Atomic Operations

**Preferred approach for user-initiated operations:**

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Frontend handles with Supabase client operations
import {supabase} from '../../config/supabase';

// For updates with increments, use PostgreSQL UPDATE
await supabase.rpc('increment_user_stats', {
  user_id: userId,
  messages: 1,
  tokens: tokens,
  cost: cost
});

// Or use direct UPDATE with atomic operations
await supabase
  .from('users')
  .update({
    total_messages: supabase.raw('total_messages + 1'),
    total_tokens: supabase.raw('total_tokens + ?', [tokens]),
    updated_at: new Date().toISOString()
  })
  .eq('id', userId);
```

**Why this is better than an Edge Function trigger:**
- ✅ Testable on experimental branch first
- ✅ Atomic via PostgreSQL (no race conditions)
- ✅ Fails gracefully (doesn't block conversation save)
- ✅ Easy rollback (git revert)
- ✅ No deployment lag

## Architecture Consistency

**Current app architecture is frontend-heavy:**
- Direct API calls to OpenRouter (chat completion)
- Direct Supabase writes (conversations, assistants, messages)
- Client-side routing and state management
- Minimal backend logic
- TanStack Query for data fetching and caching

**Maintain this consistency:**
- Don't introduce Edge Functions for operations that fit the frontend pattern
- Only add functions when truly required (see "Required Use Cases")
- Document why each function is necessary

## Decision Framework

When considering adding an Edge Function, ask:

1. **Security:** Must this logic be server-side for security?
   - Yes → Edge Function might be needed
   - No → Use frontend

2. **Secrets:** Does this require server-side credentials?
   - Yes → Edge Function needed
   - No → Use frontend

3. **Testability:** Can I test this safely on experimental branch?
   - Yes → Prefer frontend
   - No → Consider if the feature is worth the risk

4. **Failure Mode:** What happens if this fails?
   - Blocks critical operations → Consider frontend with better error handling
   - Nice-to-have feature → Definitely frontend
   - Security issue if client-side → Edge Function required

## Testing Strategy

**SSOT:** See `testing/RULE.md` for testing standards, patterns, and quality requirements.

**Edge Functions Testing Considerations:**

- Manual testing only (no staging environment)
- Changes affect both experimental and main immediately
- Consider impact before adding new functions
- Deploy via `supabase functions deploy <function-name>`

**Frontend Logic Testing Considerations:**

- Test on experimental branch
- User testing before merging to main
- Easy rollback if issues found

For complete testing guidelines and patterns, refer to `testing/RULE.md`.

## Migration Path

If an existing Edge Function could be replaced with frontend logic:

1. Implement frontend version on experimental branch
2. Test thoroughly
3. Deploy frontend changes to main
4. Monitor for issues
5. Only after proven stable, remove Edge Function
6. Document the architectural decision

## Examples from This Project

### Example 1: Usage Tracking (Moved to Frontend)

**Originally:** Edge Function trigger on conversation write
**Problem:** Bugs affect both branches, can't test safely
**Solution:** Frontend PostgreSQL UPDATE after successful save
**Result:** Simpler, testable, consistent with app architecture

### Example 2: Presentation Generation (Kept as Edge Function)

**Why Edge Function:** 
- Requires server-side Gamma API key
- External service call with authentication
- Security requirement (can't expose API key)
**Result:** Correctly uses Edge Function

## Function Organization

### Core Principle

**Group functions by Business Capability, not by technical similarity.**

## Organization Strategy

### Before Creating a New Function

1. **Analyze existing business capabilities** to which the new cloud function could belong
2. **Group functions by Business Capability**
3. **Only create a new function** when the business capability has not been covered yet
4. **Otherwise**, append or adjust existing functionality

## Example Structure

```
functions/
├── ai-chat/          # Handles conversation logic, context, and calls OpenRouter
├── gamma-generator/  # Handles specific logic for generating presentations/docs via Gamma
└── webhooks/         # Dedicated function to receive incoming data (if third parties call you back)
```

## Why This Approach?

### Performance
- If the Gamma API is slow, it doesn't block users trying to chat with the AI
- Each capability can scale independently
- Failures in one capability don't cascade to others

### Security
- API keys for OpenRouter live only inside the `ai-chat` function environment variables, never in the browser
- Each function has minimal permissions (principle of least privilege)
- Secrets are scoped to specific capabilities

### Maintainability
- Related functionality is grouped together
- Easier to understand what each function does
- Changes to one capability don't affect others

## Examples

### ✅ Good Example

```typescript
// functions/ai-chat/index.ts
// Handles all AI chat-related functionality
export async function handleRequest(req: Request): Promise<Response> {
  // Conversation logic
  // Context management
  // OpenRouter API calls
  // All AI chat capabilities in one place
}
```

### ❌ Bad Example

```typescript
// functions/api-call-1/index.ts - Generic name, unclear purpose
// functions/api-call-2/index.ts - Another generic API call
// functions/utils/index.ts - Mixed concerns
// Bad: Functions organized by technical similarity, not business capability
```

### When to Create a New Function

**Before creating a new function, ensure it meets the "When to Use Edge Functions" criteria above.**

Then, consider organization:

Create a new function when:
- A new business capability emerges that doesn't fit existing functions
- The capability has distinct performance or security requirements
- The capability needs independent scaling or deployment

Do NOT create a new function when:
- The functionality fits an existing business capability
- You can extend an existing function without breaking its single responsibility
- The change is purely technical (refactoring, not new capability)
- The operation can be handled by frontend logic (see "Avoid Edge Functions For" above)

## Summary

**Default to frontend logic** unless you have a clear security, secret management, or system event reason for Edge Functions.

The fragility of Edge Functions in this deployment model means they should be used sparingly and only when absolutely necessary.

When Edge Functions are required, organize them by business capability for better maintainability, performance, and security.

## Legacy: Firebase Cloud Functions (Deprecated)

> **Note:** This section documents the legacy Firebase Cloud Functions architecture. The project has migrated to Supabase Edge Functions. This content is kept for reference during migration period.

### Legacy Deployment Model

**This project previously used Firebase Cloud Functions that shared ONE Firebase project.**

- Frontend code deployed separately per branch (experimental vs main)
- Cloud Functions deployed ONCE and affected BOTH branches
- No staging environment for Cloud Functions
- No automated testing or rollback for functions
- Bugs in Cloud Functions impacted the entire app across all branches

### Legacy Cloud Functions

**Previously used Cloud Functions:**
- `gammaGenerate` / `gammaStatus` - Presentation generation (server-side API) → Migrated to `gamma-generate` / `gamma-status` Edge Functions
- `listUsers` / `setUserRole` / `setUserDeveloperStatus` - Admin operations → Migrated to `list-users` / `set-user-role` Edge Functions
- `onAuthUserCreate` / `onAuthUserDelete` - Auth lifecycle → Replaced by Supabase database triggers
- `testAuth` / `backfillUsersFromAuth` - Utility functions → Migrated or deprecated

### Legacy Pattern: Frontend with Firestore Atomic Operations

**Previous approach for user-initiated operations:**

```typescript
// ❌ LEGACY: Firestore operations (no longer used)
import {doc, updateDoc, increment, serverTimestamp} from 'firebase/firestore';

await updateDoc(userRef, {
  totalMessages: increment(1),
  totalTokens: increment(tokens),
  totalCost: increment(cost),
  lastUpdate: serverTimestamp()
});
```

**Migration:** This pattern has been replaced with Supabase client operations using PostgreSQL atomic updates.
